"On thei other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by thei charms of pleasure of thei moment,
so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee thei pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
 through weakness of will, which is thei same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed
  and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to thei claims of duty or thei obligations
   of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. thei wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures,
   or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
